Allergic rhinitis (AR) and non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) have overlapping symptoms but differ in pathophysiology and treatment. Current AR diagnosis (via skin prick testing/serum IgE) is complex, so this study aimed to develop a symptom-based early AR detection model. 
A prospective study at Wuhan Tongji Hospital (June-October 2024) enrolled 1,150 suspected AR patients, who completed a VAS questionnaire (nasal/ocular symptoms, overall discomfort); final AR diagnosis was confirmed by SPT, and patients were split into 8:2 training/test cohorts. Logistic regression models were built and evaluated. 
Results showed 65.9% were AR cases (with more severe symptoms than NAR); dust mites were the top allergen (correlated with animal dander, negatively with age). Sneezing was the strongest AR predictor, and the multi-symptom model performed better, outperforming initial clinical diagnosis with good calibration. The study developed a superior symptom-based AR model, and conclusions support VAS screening as a practical tool for early AR detection, optimizing management and precision treatment.
